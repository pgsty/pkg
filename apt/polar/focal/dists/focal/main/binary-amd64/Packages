Description: PolarDB is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
 (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including
 transactions, subselects and user-defined types and functions). The
 PolarDB package includes the client programs and libraries that
 you'll need to access a PolarDB DBMS server.  These PolarDB
 client programs are programs that directly manipulate the internal
 structure of PolarDB databases on a PolarDB server. These client
 programs can be located on the same machine with the PolarDB
 server, or may be on a remote machine which accesses a PolarDB
 server over a network connection. This package contains the command-line
 utilities for managing PolarDB databases on a PolarDB server.
